# Notes
* *A transaction is a glorified function call which changes data on the blockchain* 
* *A script is used to view data on the blockchain* 

## Quests

**Explain what the blockchain is**

*Blockchain is a shared database, what makes it different is the way that it collects information together in groups, also called blocks, who have a certain storage capacity.*
*When these blocks are filled with data, they are closed and linked to the previously filled block, forming a chain of data.*
*Blockchains are decentralised due to no single person , or group having control - rather , all users collectively retain control.*

**Explain what a smart contract is**

*Smart Contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement and predetermined conditions being directly written into lines of code, which exist on decentralised blockchains.*

**Explain the difference between a script and a transaction**

*A script is the tool used to view data on a blockchain network, meanwhile, a transaction changes data on the blockchain and requires some form of payment.*
